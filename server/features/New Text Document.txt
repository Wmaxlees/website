Feature: A list of events can be pulled with a GET call
	As a web developer, I would like to be able to get a list of all events
	
	Scenario 1: Developer accesses /event with GET
		Given the server is running
		And events exist in the API
		And the developer has access to the /event API
		When the user sends a GET http request to the API
		Then a JSON array of all event objects should be return over HTTP
		And the server will issue a 200 message response
		And the call is idempotent

	Scenario 2: Developer accesses /event/{event-id} with GET
		Given the server is running
		And {event-id} is an id of an event in the collection
		And the developer has access to the /event API
		When the user sends a GET http request to the API with a specific event id
		Then A JSON object of that event will be returned over HTTP response
		And the server will issue a 200 message response
		And the call is idempotent

	Scenario 3: Developer attempts to access /event/{event-id} for an event that doesn't exist with GET
		Given the server is running
		And the developer has access to the /event API
		And {event-id} is an id of an event not in the collection
		When the user sends a GET HTTP request to the API with a specific event id
		Then the server will issue a 400 message
		And the server will issue an error JSON response body
		And the call is idempotent

	Scenario 4: Developer attempts to access /event without access permission
		Given the server is running
		And the developer does not have access to the /event API
		When the developer sends a GET call to the /event API
		Then the server will issue a 401 message
		And the server will issue an error JSON response body
		And the call is idempotent

	Scenario 5: Developer attempts to access /event/{event-id} without access permission
		Given the server is running
		And the developer does not have access to the /event API
		When the developer sends a GET call to the /event API
		Then the server will issue a 401 message
		And the server will issue an error JSON response body
		And the call is idempotent
